# A Link Between Worlds Autotracker

This is a [PopTracker](https://poptracker.github.io/) pack meant for tracking items and checks in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Randomizer runs.

Forked from [Legend's ALBW AP PopTracker](https://github.com/Legendgreat/albw-ap-poptracker)

<details>

<summary>1.4.1</summary>

### 1.4.1b

- Golden bee should now properly be maintained between reconnects.

### 1.4.1

#### Location changes

- This update fixes some weird logic around Lorule Graveyard, specifically to do with lamp/firerod related logic.
- Cracks and Weather Vane locations are now trapezoid shaped. Cracks are slightly bigger than Weather Vanes so they're easier to distinguish.

#### Bug Fixes

- Trial door settings logic is fixed, and should now actually be tracked properly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.4.0</summary>

### 1.4.0

#### Layout

- This update adds compact versions of the map trackers. People were (rightfully) complaining that the original map trackers don't fit on 1080p, so the compact versions are now the default "Map Tracker (orientation)", while the original map trackers are renamed to "Full Map Tracker (orientation)". This compact version will have the compacted maps, as well as a tabbed version of the items.
  Small note: the horizontal compact variant isn't the most beautiful layout, but with the lack of centering or margins in tabs there's currently not a lot I can do to make it look better. Hopefully in a future PopTracker version I can fix that. For now, making the window as small as possible horizontally minimizes how awful it looks.
- The settings have been moved to their own settings menu on all variants, which you can find in the top toolbar next to AP.

#### Location changes

- The dungeon rewards have been re-introduced to the map. They are now directly linked to the dungeon items you see in the tracker, and are always visible even when set to ??.
- Dungeon locations on the Overworld maps are now slightly bigger, so they're easier to distinguish.

#### Bug Fixes

- Trial door settings should now be tracked properly and show the trial door as active.
- The premium milk check at the Bouldering Guy now works properly. Due to letter in a bottle and milk bar check being unavailable in the current version of ALBW APWorld, the milk bar check is now disabled when an AP connection is made. This allows z17-randomizer users to still track the milk bar trade route.

#### Remaining issues

- When swapping between AP slots or variants, some settings might not get updated properly. CTRL + Shift + R and reconnecting to AP will fix this. I want to fix this issue if possible but I'm not sure how, so I'm deferring this to a later minor release.

<summary>Older versions</summary>

<details>

<summary>1.3.x</summary>

<details>

<summary>1.3.1</summary>

### 1.3.1

#### Bug Fixes

- All cracks should now be in logic in cracksanity, with merge and quake, and some of the checks were updated for cracksanity as well.
- Hylian Shield AP item should now properly increment the shield item by two stages
- Blacksmith check should now work properly

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.3.0</summary>

### 1.3.0

#### Layout

- This update has a fresh new item layout, that looks a bit cleaner than the previous versions. Because of the new item layout, and some weird issues with resizing the window, I had to separate the vertical layout from the standard map tracker, so it's now in it's own tracker variant.
- I have also reintroduced the item tracker, which is now fully functional, including auto-tracking. Same as the map tracker, weather vanes have to be clicked, but dungeon items are auto-tracked.

#### Bug Fixes

- Premium Milk and Letter in a Bottle are now both trackable properly. I have made it in a way where you can click either milk or letter, since you aren't able to get both in any given run. (According to RickWithAnH)
- Thief Girl check is now properly available when having Thieves' Hideout reward item checked (Have to set it to Sage or Pendant, ?? doesn't work)
- Mother Maiamai checks are now disabled instead of cleared, when nice items are set to shuffled or off (From my experience they are always junked, let me know if I'm wrong)
- Death Mountain Maiamai should now appear in front of other checks too

#### Improvements

- Based on some feedback from the Archipelago Discord, future versions will have a more descriptive .zip file name, and I will be excluding the .git folder
- Removed most of the unnecessary files and images, bringing the final size of the .zip down to 20% of what it was before
- Did some minor housekeeping of the code

#### Remaining issues

- When diamond shape (Maiamai) locations overlap with square shaped ones, the square shape takes prevalence for the mouse hover. [Black Sliver](https://github.com/black-sliver/) is going to fix this in a future PopTracker update. _This is slated to be in the next release of PopTracker._

#### What's next

I'm thinking of adding in a crack tracker, right now the tracker only supports marking the tracker you went in to, and for cracksanity, the crack you come out of. I want to add a fully functional crack tracker where you can mark which crack leads where, with maybe an additional map where lines are drawn between pairs, or hovering one highlights another. I'm not sure if PopTracker supports this yet, but I'll see what I can do with the tools that I have.

<details>

<summary>1.2.x</summary>

<details>

<summary>1.2.1</summary>

### 1.2.1

- Quake is now tracked if found manually (not initial_crack_state)
- Open trials door should now be tracked
- Swordless mode is now tracked

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.2.0</summary>

### 1.2.0

#### Auto-tracked Settings

Settings from player .yaml's are now mostly auto-tracked. In a future update I will add a way to disable it if a lot of people ask for it.

Not everything _can_ be auto-tracked:

- `super_items`
- `assured_weapon`
- `skip_big_bomb_flower`
- `bow_of_light_in_castle`
- `treacherous_tower_floors`
- `keysy`

Luckily, most of these aren't important to track, except for keysy, which will still need to be manually clicked.

#### Bug Fixes

- Some checks were previously showing green when they should've been yellow or even red. Most of these were checks related to lamp in Dark and Swamp Palace, but also some logic related ones in Eastern Palace and House of Gales. All locations should now be showing the proper logic.
- The Maiamai locations in Hyrule Rupee Rush and Lorule Dark Ruins South Wall are now in the proper spot

#### Remaining issues

- Some Maiamai's in Death Mountain are still visually behind other locations, this will be fixed in a smaller update.

I will probably focus on the vertical layout of the Standard Tracker next.

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.1.x</summary>

<details>

<summary>1.1.2</summary>

### 1.1.2

- Fixed the versions_url link in manifest.json for automatic updates

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.1.1</summary>

### 1.1.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Master Ore is now auto-tracked properly
- Hyrule Castle checks are now auto-tracked properly
- Changed the Mother Maiamai location on Hyrule Overworld map temporarily, until the diamond shape hover issue is fixed in PopTracker
- Death Mountain Maiamai locations are now diamond shaped too

#### Improvements

- Added automatic pack update notifications

#### Remaining issues

- When diamond shape (Maiamai) locations overlap with square shaped ones, the square shape takes prevalence for the mouse hover. [Black Sliver](https://github.com/black-sliver/) is going to fix this in a future PopTracker update.

</details>

<details>

<summary>1.1.0</summary>

### 1.1.0

#### Bug Fixes

- Tracker should now display properly on resolutions below 1440p
- Lorule Castle small keys are now auto-tracked properly
- Osfala rented item is now tracked properly

#### Improvements

- All locations are a bit smaller so it's easier to look at
- Maiamai checks are now diamond shaped so they're easier to distinguish from item checks, they also appear in front instead of behind other checks
- Dungeon map images are now combined, and have a floor label
- Bottle for trade quest is now 1 combined letter/milk bottle based on information from RickWithAnH, and should alleviate some confusion around how it's randomized
- Rainbow sage and rainbow pendant is removed from the dungeon prize tracker, and all pendants are now in there
- Sages in every dungeon's prize tracker now have numbers next to them to make them easier to distinguish when they are still greyed out (1 = gulley, 2 = oren, etc.)
- Added a Go! Mode tracker in the Lorule Castle key tracker, where there was previously nothing. May or may not work, untested.

#### Remaining issues

- Due to refactor of the dungeon locations, sages and pendants are not properly displayed in dungeons, but still work when toggled in the dungeon item tracker in the bottom dock

If dungeon location checks don't match up with where they should, please let me know. I made sure to test this time but there's a chance I missed something.

## Description

Doing my own runs I noticed a lack of an up-to-date autotracker for this game. This pack is heavily based on [ALBW PopTracker](https://github.com/arborelia/albw-poptracker/tree/main) made by arborelia, and [ALBW Randomizer Tracker] made by RickWithAnH. The last update to arborelia's pack was a while ago when I started this pack, and not everything was working. So I decided to continue their work. Having noticed the recent uptick in ALBW players on Archipelago's Discord, I decided to share my work.

That said, please share any issues with the pack you might come across. If you do, please make an issue on the GitHub repo.

The tracker's logic is based on [z17-randomizer](https://github.com/rickfay/z17-randomizer) made by RickWithAnH.

## Usage Guide

### Untrackable Items and Locations

[](https://github.com/guigui0246/albw-ap-poptracker/tree/master#untrackable-items-and-locations)

Not all locations are randomized, and thus not auto-trackable. See [Untrackable Items and Locations](https://github.com/guigui0246/albw-ap-poptracker/blob/main/docs/UNTRACKABLE.md) for a list of untrackable items and locations.

### Tracker Guide

[](https://github.com/guigui0246/albw-ap-poptracker/tree/master#tracker-guide)

See the [Tracker Guide](https://github.com/guigui0246/albw-ap-poptracker/blob/main/docs/GUIDE.md) for info about the tracker itself, and logic surrounding various settings, sages and pendants.
